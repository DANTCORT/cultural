                <p>
                    Cultural diversity is the differences between groups of people. These groups can be divided for country, language, religion, ideas, or any differences.
                    The importance of understanding cultural diversity is because the world revolves around people, and we need to understand the differences in the culture to have respect and awareness of our actions.

            <h2>Language Barriers</h2>
                <p>
                    The language barrier is any complication in understanding a person or a meaning. You can not understand the language for a lot of reasons, maybe it is a different 
                    language or is a technical language, I do not know. 
                    If you don't understand the language, you can't comprehend the topic. 
                    This can be bad, because you do not have an answer or an idea to solve the problem. 
                    If you have problems with language barriers, you can solve it by using simple language, use any app to translate text or audio and go to class to understand the language.

            <h2>Cultural Misunderstandings</h2>
                <p>
                    Stereotypes are the ideas that people have about how a person should  dress, speak, etc. Prejudices are the idea about how you behave. 
 You can solve it by being informed about the topic, understanding cultural diversity and knowing how to act in different contexts.

            <p>
                Acculturation is when we adapt to a culture, we can have this from when we are children or later when we are adults. It is related to conquests and political movements. 
            Assimilation is when we adapt to a culture because it is the predominant culture.
            Amalgamation is when two cultures blend and the result is a new culture with things 
            about two topics.

           <p>
            If we interact with people or situations from other cultures, we can see the world differently, since we question things and can understand different world contexts. We can also respect their culture, their way of life, or any situation.

            <h2>Celebrating diversity</h2>
           <p> In the world we can find beautiful festivals. I think the following festivals are some of the best in the world:
            <strong>Naadam Festival - Mongolia</strong>: This festival is celebrated on July 10-13 July in Mongolia 's capital Ulaanbaatar. In the festival we can find different sports to play for the mens and colors.
            <strong>Holi - India</strong>: It is the most popular festival in India and the most colorful festival. It has many purposes: celebrating the victory of good over evil, the beginning of spring, the beginning of the new year and others.
            <strong>Thimphu Tshechu Festival - Bhutan</strong>: It is the biggest festival to celebrate a god in Himalayan. This has a duration of 3 days to invoke a god, in the 3 days, the people dance in the courtyard “Tashichho Dzong”.
            <strong>Inti Raymi - Peru</strong>: It dates back to 500 years ago where they celebrate one of the most venerated gods in the Inca Empire with sacrifice, but actually only celebrate dancing and the woman sweep away negative souls. 
            <strong>Timket Festival - Ethiopia</strong>: It is considered the most colorful event in the country. The orthodox christian go to the festival to recreate the baptism of Jesus in the Jordan river. 
            This festival lasts 2 days.

            <h2>Understanding Immigration</h2>
           <p> The people migrated to other countries because they needed to find the best economic situation, study, escape to conflict, do not have rights and other reasons.  
            The migrants have different challenges, some of these are the language barrier, finding employer, accessing to education, family in other countries, stable financial situation and others,

           <p> When people arrive in a different country, they need to find employment, school, friendships, religion, food, clothes, the form to move to the new city, and other things.
            The people can support migrants by treating them with respect, holding events that include them in the community, and the government has programs for migrants.
